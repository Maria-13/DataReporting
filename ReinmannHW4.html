## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Homework assignment #4

############################## 

# Your full name: Relika Reinmann

# Date: 19.10.22

####### TASK 1: 5 points. Short EDA report

# The main aim of the task is to import data into R, perform brief explanatory analysis, build at least one plot,

# export data using R Markdown and 'knit' by creating an html.file

# 1. Go to <https://andmed.stat.ee/en/stat> and create a data set you want to explore. Import the data into R.

# 2. Prepare EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis). Write at least 5 questions and provide your answers during the first stage of EDA.

# (You can check the slides from Session 5 - Data Exploration (EDA) for ideas or come up with your own questions).

# 3. Provide brief descriptive statistical analysis of your data set (like measures of central tendency and dispersion).

# 4. Include at least one plot into your report.

# If ggplot2 is too complicated for you now, create a plot with R base functions.

# 5. Create a pdf or html file with short EDA of your data set. Send a pdf file directly to me, send html code

# through a gist on GitHub.

#1. installed different packages, selected the data set and imported it
to R as "Culturalevents" install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

library(readxl)

library(tibble)

install.packages("googlesheets4") library(googlesheets4)

#Read google sheets data into R culturalevents \<-

print(culturalevents)

str(culturalevents)

total_number =
culturalevents$`2020 total` # created the variables total_YES = culturalevents$`2020 Persons YES`
total_NO =
culturalevents$`2020 Persons NO` male = culturalevents$Persons[1] female
= culturalevents$Persons[2] persons = culturalevents$Persons[4, 1]
#wanted to create a variable for the first column but i don't succeed in
it

#2. EDA: my questions and answeres \# What metadata is available for
this data set? Are the descriptions of variables provided? What do we
know about the sampling? \# On metadata - information on methodology and
quality is shared, including concepts and classifications, source data
and data compilation.

# What are the observed population, the observation unit and the reference period?

# Population is at least 15 year old people, observation unit is number of person, reference period is 2020

# What are the data types of the variables? Do we need to change them?

# As data types we have double for numbers and character for Persons. Changed doubles to numeric values.

# Are there any outliers? Are there any values that look like errors?

# everything looks like an error

# Are there any null/NA values?

# no

# 3. Provide brief descriptive statistical analysis of your data set (like measures of central tendency and dispersion).

culturalevents$`2020 total` <- as.numeric(culturalevents$`2020 total`)
\# Change 2020 total amount of people to integer
culturalevents$`2020 Persons NO` <- as.numeric(culturalevents$`2020 Persons NO`)
\# Change 2020 number of persons who didn't go to events to integer
culturalevents$`2020 Persons YES` <- as.numeric(culturalevents$`2020 Persons YES`)

print(culturalevents)

mean(total_number) \# avarage for 2020 museum visits is 349

mean(total_NO) \# avarage for people who didn't go to cultural events
2020 was 77

median(total_number) \# median for total visits which is 507
median(total_NO) \# median for NO visits 98

estimate_mode \<- function(x) { d \<- density(x) d$x[which.max(d$y)] }

estimate_mode(total_number) \# estimated mode for total visits is 539
estimate_mode(total_NO) \# same for NO visits is 120

sd(total_number) \# sd 246 sd(total_NO) \# sd NO 58

var(total_number) \# 60708 var(total_NO) \# 3468

quantile(total_number) quantile(total_NO)

# 4. Include at least one plot into your report.

boxplot(culturalevents$`2020 total`, horizontal = TRUE) boxplot(culturalevents$`2020 Persons NO`,
horizontal = TRUE)

hist(total_number) hist(total_NO) \# both of them look weird

plot(total_number, total_NO)

# 5. Create a pdf or html file with short EDA of your data set. Send a pdf file directly to me, send html code

# through a gist on GitHub.
